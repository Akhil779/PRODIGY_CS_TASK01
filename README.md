The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that was used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to his allies. It works by shifting the letters in the plaintext message by a certain number of positions, known as the "shift" or "key". The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest methods of encryption techniques.

It's simply a type of substitution cipher, i.e., each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter with a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The method is apparently named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his officials.
